Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the flour mixture. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the boiling water (batter will be thin). Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting and enjoy! Notes For a richer flavor, you can use coffee instead of boiling water. Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature for best results.","title":"Chocolate Cake Recipe"},{"location":"example/#chocolate-cake-recipe","text":"","title":"Chocolate Cake Recipe"},{"location":"example/#ingredients","text":"1 and 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour 1 and 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar 3/4 cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs 1 cup (240ml) whole milk 1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup (240ml) boiling water","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"example/#instructions","text":"Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).
